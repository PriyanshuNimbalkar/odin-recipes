    <p>
      Amti is a classic Maharashtrian dal preparation made with toor dal (split
      pigeon peas), flavored with goda masala, jaggery, tamarind or kokum, and a
      tempering of mustard seeds, cumin, curry leaves, and green chilies. It is
      known for its balanced sweet, tangy, and mildly spicy flavors, and is
      typically enjoyed with steamed rice and a dollop of ghee.
